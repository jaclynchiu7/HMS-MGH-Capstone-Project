Data is extracted from the website American Hospital Directory. The code involves web scraping, but I am unsure if it is legal or if this is allowed for the capstone project. 

There is a limited amount of times you can visit the website. Alternatively, as a university data we can ask for data through a subscription. https://www.ahd.com/university_subscription_order_form.pdf
